	<p> Each year technology always improves and we continue to incorporate it in our everyday lives. Think about this. Apple comes out with Siri. Google comes out with Alexa. You can simply ask them one question and best believe they'll have the answer you are looking for. More and more everyday there is way more advanced technology that is being made and is way more smarter than any humankind. What more can we expect for our future generations? Driving cars are now able to drive themsleves while the driver just sits back, people are getting fired since robots take over their jobs. What more can we expec</p>

			<h3> Agree </h3>
			<h4> Ali Ghaly </h4>
			<p> I agreed with you because technology has been around us for years and we humans tried to see what else can technology do for us in the future. I liked the picture that you put on your blog. </p>

	<p>Technology is now improving and getting more advanced. Which means robots would probably take over. Employers wouldn't have to worry about humans making mistakes andlsoing money. Since with robots you don't have to pay them. Although they might take jobs they wouldn't be able to take our jobs. Everyday robots are still ebing developed and throughout the time they still aren't "perfect" and still need work to be done on them. </p>

			<h3>Agreed!!!!</h3>
			<h4>Alma Potrero</h4>
			<p>I agree with everything you've said in this paragraph. Robots are taking over but until theyre really truly developed it will be a constant hassle trying to fix any errors they'll encounter in the future. P.s I like your color combination :) </p>

			<h4>valentina silva</h4>
			<p>I think your paragraph has a strong opinion on why robots could not replace us, and I agree with you on the fact that robots could function for short term but eventually it would break. I like the image you decided to put in the blog is really appeling to the eye.  </p>
